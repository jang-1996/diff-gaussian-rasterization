# Differential Gaussian Rasterization for 3D-GSW

We use the rasterization engine from "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields" and have extended it by obtaining the positions of 3D Gaussians on a 2D image. 
If you make use of this repository, please kindly cite the original 3D-GS paper.
